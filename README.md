# Build-a-Virtual-Private-Cloud
A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)  is an isolated network in the cloud, enabling secure and scalable resource deployment. It includes subnets, routing, and security controls. In AWS, a VPC is created by defining a CIDR block, setting up subnets, configuring security, and deploying resources for controlled connectivity.
